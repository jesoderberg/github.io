Data Engineering & Geospatial Analytics üó∫Ô∏è
======
Passionate about building robust data pipelines and creating beautiful, informative maps. I specialize in transforming messy real-world data into clean, actionable insights using Python and GIS tools.

Core Focus Areas
======
* **Data Quality Engineering**: Developing robust data validation frameworks and ETL pipelines to ensure accuracy from collection to analysis. Experience with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and data quality frameworks.

* **Geospatial Analysis**: Leveraging GeoPandas, PostGIS, and QGIS to analyze spatial relationships and create compelling visualizations. From environmental monitoring to urban planning, I bring geographic context to data stories.

* **Web Scraping & Automation**: Building efficient scrapers with Python (Beautiful Soup, Selenium) to gather data from diverse sources while respecting rate limits and site policies.

Current Projects
======
* Developing automated validation checks for spatial data ingestion
* Creating interactive web maps using Folium and Leaflet
* Building ETL pipelines for environmental monitoring data
* Exploring machine learning applications in spatial analysis

Tools & Technologies
======
* **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript
* **Spatial**: QGIS, ArcGIS, GeoPandas, PostGIS
* **Data Engineering**: pandas, NumPy, PostgreSQL
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Folium, Leaflet
